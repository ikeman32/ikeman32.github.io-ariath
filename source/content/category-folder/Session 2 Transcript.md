## Session 2 Scene 1

\[back and forth]

DM: Alright, Joryth. You're going to enter into this tavern. The tavern is horribly  constructed. Okay, I mean, it's absolutely terrible. Water's leaking through the roof. It's storming. You know, just a really \[expletive] night. You, as you're walking into town, you hear a bunch of, like, yelling and murmuring as if something's been happening, but you're not quite sure. And for whatever reason, you make your way over to the tavern. You enter in, and you see three adventurers talking to what appears to be a bartender. You see a woman sitting in a black puddle of ichor and blood, and a woman tending to her. Outside  of the tavern, you saw a man by the name of Father Aldrich, who appeared to have been walking out murmuring to himself as if he was pissed off. From there, I'll leave it to you guys.

Thief: Guilty. \[giggles]

Bard2: What is my reasoning for coming in, if I have one?
DM: Honestly, that's more or less up to you. Whatever it is, you made your way into the inn, it might have just been a very good hub for you to get information. Because inns are kind of known for that thing.

Bard2: Okay. Okay.

DM: Other than that, we're gonna basically leave off where the party was getting their supplies from Barlow. Hopefully you guys got what you wanted for your characters. Otherwise,  you're kind of SOL. What now?

Bard1: I said I got what I wanted.

DM: Okay, great. But yeah, so I'm gonna kind of leave that up to you guys. The party is going to see... Joryth, would you like to introduce your character, or how they look at least?

Bard2: Okay. Uh, my character is... Can you, can you make the, like, enlarge the picture?

DM: Oh, can you not control your character?

Bard2: No, I can't.

DM: Oh, of course you can't. Hold on. Roll 20's been giving me a bad time about that.

Bard1: How do you enlarge the picture? I can't do that.

Bard2: Oh, there you go. Joryth is a Eladrin,  Bard of Elegance. College of Elegance. Right now, of course, like, because of, her race, she can change her appearance depending on the seasons. Right now, this is pretty much what she defaults look like. She is a redhead, Indian-looking tan. She has a, an earring with a feather on it. And she, that's what, that's what she looks like. She has green eyes.

Thief: And what was her race again?

Bard2: Eladrin.

Thief: Eladrin?

Bard2: They are fey-elf that, yeah, just fey-elfs, I guess you could say.

Thief: Fey-elf? Oh, she's, so she's like a full-blooded elf. Kinda.

Bard2: I would say when she comes in, she, probably isn't used to being in a worn-out

place. Her clothes look rich. Her, I don't know if I need to give backstory too much, but long story short, what she does for a living is tricking rich people using her bard, you know, charisma to change their mind by making them think that their idea is their own in a, in a mysterious way.

Wizard: So basically you \[expletive] everybody.

Bard2: Basically what?

Wizard: You basically \[expletive] them, basically.

Bard2: Yes. Yes, I do. And, she has a, I'm gonna try to do a voice for her, but she's like, rogue, from X-Men, type of thing.

Wizard: Aw, cool.

Bard2: And she's got some sayings that she'll, every once in a while say when the time's appropriate. When she comes in, she probably sees the group, but then sees this lady being bathed in ichor, and that makes her, cringe a little, and she'll probably walk up to Barlow and the group, like, oh my, what, what is going on over there? That doesn't look pleasant at all. Pointing.

DM: And I guess that's really a cue for the rest of the group.

Bard2: Yes.

Bard1: That's, uh, something we're trying to figure out right now.

Bard2: Oh. Hmm.

Thief: What we do know is she's afflicted by some sort of magic.

Bard2: Hmm. She, she'd, like, shake her head and be like, oh,I am Joyrith. Nice to meet you all.

Bard1: I'm, I'm Harmony.

Bard1: Nice to meet you as well.

Wizard: Yeah, my name's Dinver.

Thief: Rafros.

Bard2: Well met.

DM: UBarlow, the bartender, is going to look back and, roll his eyes. Great. Another one.

He's gonna pick up the now empty box and start making his way to the back.

Thief: Okay, quick question. Did you,read the session notes that are posted online? Uh, the link is in the...

DM: Oh, online? I read the ones in your, uh, in your player.

Thief: Well, I mean, I'm talking to the new character. I've got every, I got the last session transcripted.

Bard2: I do, I did, but I did it, like, a few days ago, so. I know some details, not all of them.

Thief: Okay, so you.

DM: Realistically, his character probably wouldn't know, so.

Thief: Right. Well, like I said, we could just, someone could say, just, we, relay what's happened so far, and then you'd be up to speed without actually having to go through the whole spiel if he's read the notes.

Bard2: Gotcha. Okay. Yeah, yeah, that works.

DM: Okay. So, is that general consensus that you guys just, like, give him the general idea of what's happening?

Wizard: Yeah.

DM: Okay. Cool. Well, I guess if no one's going to say anything, Barlow's gonna come back out. He's gonna hand, the rogue. Yeah, he's gonna hand you the, he's gonna hand you the, he's gonna hand you the map. This map is a, it's a pretty sketchy map. It's, it's nothing really too great, but it does give you the general location that you need to go in order to get to the next town over. Let me open up the large map. Give me just a second. You're gonna get a map over to Inkfell.

Bard1: Inkfell.

DM: Yes. Inkfell, whilst not the largest city in Yula, it is the closest by a fair amount, and those who have any understanding of the region would know that it is, it's as close to it as a city as a town could get.

Bard1: A suburb?

DM: Think of like, the largest town before it gets categorized as a city. Right, like, it's trying really hard. But not quite.

Bard1: Yeah, fair enough. I think, we've got a few places here in my city like that.

DM: Yeah. It's like, yeah, you know. He's gonna hand you this map, and he goes, well, if you're really, looking to get out of this town, which I don't blame you, this is the best bet you're gonna have.

Bard1: Who's he hand that to?

DM: He's gonna hand it to your wonderfully dashing rogue over here.

Thief: I'm the one who pissed off the priest.

DM: This board is not cooperating with me.

Thief: Do you have, like, a picture of this map somewhere? Or is it just kind of, just kind of a general?

DM: It's, it's honestly, it's just, it's just like a general map. It's not, it's really nothing, like, the little region of Yula is pretty much what you're gonna see. And you're basically gonna see yourself, like, you're gonna see this little tiny dot saying that it's, uh, Dalewatch. And then you kinda see, like, a general location up to Inkfell. There's no real map where you need to follow.

Thief: Okay. So, about how far away would you...

DM: You can clearly deduce that it's gonna be a few weeks of travel at the least. It is a long road.

Thief: Well, if it would take several weeks to get to this town, I don't think this town, get, I don't think Dalewatch has that much time.

DM: Probably not. Barlow, upon hearing you say that, kinda shakes his head and shrugs. Yeah, I think, the majority of us are looking to get out of here at this point. I think it's a lost cause.

Thief: What do you guys think? I, I say we go find this, Mila character and question her.

Bard1: I still think that we should do that as well.

Wizard: Sounds like a plan to me.

## Session 2 Scene 2

DM: Alright. Give me just a moment. Actually, we don't even need to get a map up for this. You guys will make your ways down to where Mila's house would be. Barlow would give you guys clear directions on where it is. And when you get close to Mila's house, you will  smell a foul stench. Like, absolutely horrendous. I'd say it's something close to brimstone and corpse.

Bard1: Mmm, lovely.

Thief: Burt flesh.

DM: If you guys were to approach this house... yes. Like, dead flesh and brimstone. And if you guys were to approach this house, you're gonna realize rather quickly that it is as if no  one has ever been there. There is no lights. No signs of anyone living inside. And just to expedite it some, if you were to enter the house, you're going to find nothing in there. No signs of her being there. No signs of anyone being there in quite some time. In fact,  there are cobwebs that would suggest that it's been empty for years.

Bard1: Can I roll, like, an arcana or an insight check to see if this is all, like, fake?

DM: Yeah, give me a roll.

Bard1: Alright, which one would you prefer?

DM: Either.

Bard1: I do insight. I got a 16.

DM: You are able to deduce that this is very much so real.

These, the ecosystem within this house truly suggest that no one has ever been in here.

Bard1: I don't like that.

DM: However, that foul stench still emanates from the house.

Rather evenly, I would say.

Thief: Rather evenly. Hmm. Well.

Wizard: I'm gonna cast Detect Magic.

DM: Okay. Once you cast Detect Magic, you will actually, see that there's a part of the floorboard that is emanating magic. It seems to be pulsating some sort of weird, how, how would it, what type of magic would it be? Transmutation? Maybe transmutation.

Wizard: Is it the same magic I've seen over the map? Or the letter?

DM: No. That's divination magic.

Wizard: Oh, okay. I relay that magic and I go directly to the spot on the floor.

DM: You're gonna, what?

Wizard: I relay the, what I see. Yup. And I'm going to where, uh, the...

DM: The plot is?

Wizard: Yeah.

DM: Okay. Yeah. So I guess everyone's in the know now.

Bard1: Yeah, and I'm gonna go up to it as well.

As you guys, uh, approach the floorboards, it looks like a regular set of floorboards. Maybe a little loose. But other than that, it's nothing too peculiar.

Bard1: Who's got best strength?

Bard2: Not I.

Wizard: Yeah, not me.

DM: I love how well-balanced the party is.

Thief: I got about a 10\. Let's see.

DM: A ten?

Bard1: So we... Yeah. Um, so... I'm plus zero, so I don't wanna, like, pull it up.

Bard1: I'm minus one.

DM: Okay.

I would say after a reasonable amount of time, you guys finally are able to pull up this floorboard. And inside, you're going to find, uh... Ooh. Let me roll for this, actually. I think  you guys are gonna need it. We have a single bard in the party?

Bard1: Two.

DM: Oh, yeah. We have two bards. You're gonna find three potions of greater healing. So, 4d4 plus four, I believe, that is.  And... Inside, you notice that everything within is covered in this weird, embryonic fluid. It's... It's almost like it's spider webs of mucosa that is, like,  actively grabbing at your skin as you try grabbing these potions. It is very slimy, and its  stench is beyond foul. You'd say it's reminiscent to placenta, as if... But if placenta was  alive. 

Thief: Oh. Great. Some sort of ooze.

Bard1: Yuk. So, alright. So, there's only three, right?

DM: Yep.

Bard1: Who... Who wants to take one? Someone's not gonna have one.

Thief: I don't need one.

Wizard: I'll take one.

Thief: I got two potions.

Bard1: I would like to have one. 

Bard2: Who has two potions?

Thief: Oh, we had... We had potions from, Previously. They're minor healing, though. There's three potions of greater healing. So, I'll... Pass on taking one.

Bard1: Alright. So, then... The rest of us get one. Yeah. Me, Joryth, and,  Dinver all get one potion.

Thief: But we're... We gotta deal with this thing that's... Attacking us.

DM: Oh, no, no, no. It's not... It's not attacking you.

Thief: It's not...

DM: Yeah.

Thief: It's just real icky.

DM: No, it's not hostile.

Thief: Okay.

DM: Yes, it is just... It's just very disgusting. And... As you reach your hands in... And grab out the potions... You will... Notice... Or... One of you guys will see. I'm not gonna have anyone roll for it, cause... Law of average. That, there is a small vial... What appears to be perfume inside.

Bard1: Hmm.  Don't trust that.

Bard2: Deeper... Deeper in this ooze.

DM: Yep.

Bard2: I would say... Can this ooze be... Prestidigitation... Off of... Off of me?

DM: Yeah, absolutely.

Bard2: Okay. Then... Joiryth doesn't mind... Being the one to grab it. As long as she can... Continue to use... Prestidigitation.

DM: Yeah. Yeah, you grab the... Uh... Perfume. 

Bard1: Haromony is cringing to herself. She hates it.

Bard2: Joiryth isn't fond of it either. But... If it helps... The group...

DM: Those... Who... Are knowledgeable... On... The fineries of life... You would be able to  tell... That this is... An exquisite... Perfume. Like... Befitting... Someone... Greater... Than... Your average... Nobleman. Even.

Bard2: Joirith would...

Relay that info.

Seems to be some type of rich folks perfume.

DM: Other than that... There is... Seems to be nothing else... In this house.

Thief: Just...

Bard1: I don't trust it.

Thief: Out of curiosity... I want to check for traps.

DM: Where?

Thief: I don't know. In the floorboards. Haha.

DM: Okay. So just... Like... Throughout the house essentially.

Thief: Yeah.

DM: Mostly on the floorboards.

tight: Right.

Bard2: Joirith would probably relay... There being probably... More... Under the house. Like more too under. Whether that be dead bodies or whatever. Because... Of the stench.

Bard1: Yeah. I wanna... I wanna roll some kind of... Investigation check for it. 

Wizard: I'm gonna, pop out my familiar.

DM: Mhm.

Wizard: And... I am gonna have her go underneath the house.

DM: You are... Diabolical. I feel... You know... We need to call like... Animal Protective Services.

\[back and forth about cat]

Bard2: Oh there is perfume. Cool. Vile of perfume.

DM: Yes. Just edit that... To like... Emphasize that it's like... Exquisite perfume. You would estimate that that vial alone is worth about 500 gold.

Bard2: Damn. Okay.

Thief: Holy \[expletive].

Bard1: Would I know anything about this specific perfume.

DM: Assuming that... You... Were allowed to... To see it... At any like... Point. Yes. It's like... It's pretty obvious to people who are in that circle. Through your investigations everyone. I'm not even gonna have anyone roll. There seems to be almost... There is... Nothing abnormal about this house. Aside from that one spot. Even under the floorboards... It is all perfectly normal. Literally if you were to go under... There would be no placenta anywhere. It's almost as if... Like this one cubby... Is it's... Is in it's own space. 

Thief: Oh an extra dimensional space.

Bard1: Is that where the smell was coming from then?

DM: Yes.

You'd guys be able to deduce that is where the smell comes from.

Thief: Interesting. An extra dimensional space... In the floor.

DM: Yes.

Theif: Now all we have to do is get a bag of holding and throw it in there.

No. Don't wanna do that.

DM: Yeah. Black hole the world.

Thief:  \[laughs]

Bard2: This... This ooze... You said that it... That it moves on our skin, right?

DM: Yes. It's almost as if it's trying to grab onto you.

Bard1:  Can I stab it?

Bard2: I was...

DM: Go for it.

Bard2: If you wanna stab it, go for it.

Bard1: I wanna stab it. I don't like it.

Bard2: I was gonna say, if it seems like it's alive to Joryth, she would cast Detect Thoughts.

DM: It seems alive, but is that a spell that you have limited spell slots on?

Bard2: Let me look, actually.

Bard1: That's second level for me, I don't know how you...

Bard2: So... Yes and no.  I can cast it... I believe it will.

Bard1: Is it a cantrip?

Bard2: It's part of my feat.

DM: Oh yeah, because you have...

Yeah, your feat.

You're absolutely correct.

You said that, man.

Bard2: It's how she \[expletive] people, but she...

Above table...

Above table, she's a telepath.

Telepathic.

But she probably will keep that secret forever.

If she can keep it.

DM: You could try.

However, you're not going to get any reception.

Bard2: No reception. Not even surface thoughts. Like it wants... Like it's some type of symbiote or something that wants a host.

DM: View it more as like a... Like a body's alive, but imagine if the person didn't have like... A brain. They can't relate.

Bard2: Gotcha. Okay.

Bard1: Do I need to roll a hit dice or do I just roll damage?

DM: No, I want to say... I want you to roll a hit die.

Bard1: Okay.

DM: Come on, roll a one.

Bard1: \[rolls dice] I got an eight!

DM: Aw.

Nah, you hit it.

Uh, you hit it and...

Yup, you stabbed Ooze, I guess.

You stabbed it.

Bard1: I did four damage.

DM: Yup. You destroy a little bit of it. But other than that, it doesn't really seem like you made much progress.

Bard2: Question. The one that she did damage to, does it now no longer move?

DM: She'll stab it. And it's a rapier you're using, correct?

Bard1: A dagger. Dagger, okay.

DM: You stab with your dagger, pull it out, and it kinda just reforms around. That hole.

Bard1: Ew.

Bard2: I just wasn't sure if like, the part that she stabbed no longer moves. But it just reforms back with itself, basically.

DM: Yeah, it's very contiguous. It's not as if any one part is more alive than the other. If it's really alive at all. Right?

\[of topic back and forth]

Bard2: Okay. I know, I'm going to move further away from it.

Bard1: Yeah, I don't like it.

Thief: Question.

What is the surrounding area of this house like?

DM: Like the outside surrounding area?

Thief: Yeah.

DM: It looks like just about everywhere else. It is a lightly wooded, like, farm town. Normal  amounts of grass. Everything just seems very normal. Despite the situation.

Thief: Yeah, so if we set the house on fire, it'll probably burn the town down?

DM: As far as the state of that, I mean, it is like pouring outside.

I mean, you could.

I mean, I don't know if the townsfolk would appreciate that.

Thief: Probably not.

Bard1: Well, if no one's been here, then...

Bard2: Well, this perfume belongs to somebody, I would think. Or belong.

DM: And on the whole, no one's been there thing, is like, if someone in your town, like, burnt down a house, and you're like, damn, like, no one lived there, but... It's kinda crazy.

Thief: Well, I know.

\[back and forth about the house]

DM: Any more questions for the house?

Thief: Nope.

Maybe we should wait till night, till first light and go out, look for that

snake we saw.

Bard1: Maybe.

DM: You definitely could. I support that idea.

Bard1: We have more people that could...

Bard2: She goes, oh, a snake? Tell me more.

\[back and forth discussion about the snake]

## Session2 Scene 3

DM: Okay. So you guys want to go back to the inn and sleep?

party: Yeah.

Bard1: We do long rest?

DM: Yeah. You guys can get a long rest in. You're going to get into the tavern, and it's empty enough. Barlow's is going to give you guys, uh, the rights to the rooms upstairs, seeing that no one's here anyways. So, it's not a big deal. Does everyone here sleep?

wizard and Bard1: Yes.

Bard2: I think I trance.

DM: You don't sleep. Yes. That is correct. So everyone who sleep...

Bard2: Let me just make sure. Doo doo doo species.

Thief: Do half-hells trance, or do they sleep?

Wizard: Yeah, they trance.

Bard2: I have a trance, yes. I do trance.

\[back and forth]

DM: Okay. For those who sleep, you're gonna get, you're gonna get a series of odd nightmares. Nothing too, um, unusual, but they all seem to be very serpentine, very serpent-related. And for those who trance, you just get a very uneasy feeling as you're trying to trance. Almost as if your connection to, whatever elf heaven is. Sorry, I forgot what it's called.

Bard2: Trance like meditation.

DM: So the trance for elves is like, uh, you go into like this weird state of, like, spiritual heaven. Super cool lore. But it's almost as if that is severed. You're trancing, and there's no mechanical defect, but it's as if something's just wrong. You're not quite able to put your finger on it.

Theif: But we still get the benefit of the trance.

DM: Yeah, you guys, no mechanical defect.

Bard1: When we wake up, I do have an idea.

I do have an idea.

DM: Mm-hmm.

Bard1: I would like to cast enhance ability on us. So, and I'm gonna have, or wait, let me see this.

DM: You can only work on yourself that second of them.

Bard1: It is, it is a one willing creature, but I do have two of them.

DM: You can only concentrate on one spell at a time.

Bard1: Okay.

Alright, who has the lowest stealth?

I got plus two.

Wizard: I got plus four.

Bard2: It's probably the mage.

Thief: I got plus seven.

Bard1: Alright, so you don't need it.

Bard2: Of course you do, Rogue.

But, for me, I can send, my familiar in, and I can look through its eyes. So I can be almost a hundred feet away. Well, all of us technically can. And I can just send her through.

Bard2: But I think that when you go into that trance where you're looking into their eyes, you're not in, like, you can't control your body.

Bard1: Right. 

\[back and forth]

DM: Alright.

You guys are going to make your way back to the same general location that you were. Where that blood trail was, right? If you guys remember that. Where the ruts led to a different direction. It appears that there are absolutely no ruts anymore. Almost as if the ruts were never there to begin with. If someone were to... Well actually, if you guys would like to make an investigation check or a perception check. That'd be great.

Wizard: Yeah, I'll do a perception check.

DM: Okay. Fantastic. You were able to tell that these ruts were not covered by what, by the rain or by any sort of like natural occurrence. It is literally as if there was nothing there to begin with.

Wizard: As we're standing here, I'm gonna, vamp in the eyes of my familiar. And it can see invisibility.

DM: Yep. As you do that, absolutely no change in your perception. Um, there is nothing visible in your vicinity. It is literally as if nothing has occurred here. Other than the blood trail that goes the other direction.

Wizard: That is really weird.

Bard2: You said it was here?

Thief: Yes, it was.

\[back and forth]

Wizard: So, I will cast detect magic.

DM: You cast detect magic and, aside from the general, like, faint magic in the air. In the air, from what you could deduce is from where that one creature died and went

into the ground, there is absolutely no magic. And the further you were to go down the trail

of that snake, the less magic there is.

Bard1: So it left... that's terrifying.

DM: If you guys were to go down that trail, where the leaves would have fallen from the quaking of the snake's movement, you can obviously tell that they are perfectly fine. The trees dropped no leaves and there is absolutely no disturbance.

Wizard: I'm almost wondering if that was a minor illusion.

Bard1: That was no minor.

Wizard: Or not minor illusion, but some kind of illusion.

Thief: None of us tried to disbelieve it, so... we don't know.

\[back and forth]

Wizard: I kinda look at her like she doesn't believe us. And, uh, I ask for the letter.

Thief: Oh. I whip out the letter.

The note.

Wizard: Have her read it.

Bard2: Okay. Well, she'll pull it out and read it.

DM: Alright. So you read the note?

Bard2: Yes.

DM: Okay. Give me a wisdom save.

Bard2: 15.

DM: Alright. As you read the note, uh, you are getting weird visions. You hear these voices whisper to you. Hundreds of thousands of voices whisper to you. All coalescing into one singular voice. You hear it ask for help. For aid from you. And, as the whispers end, you are now feeling as if you are within the body of a little girl. Before your vision ends, the last thing that you see, well, the only thing that you see in her form, is a curved ritual blade peering over your heart as if it's about to plunge. And right before it does, the vision ends.

Bard2: So, is, it was like my, my heart, or me in the body of the little girl being stabbed?

DM: Like as if you are the little girl.

Bard2: Okay.

DM: Yes.

wiard: I look at her now, now do you think we're full of \[expletive]?

Bard2: Well, that's, that's different. And she just gives you the, the message back and she  goes, \[sighs] Magic is never, never easy.

DM: What languages do you speak? I forgot to ask.

Bard2: I, speak, Common, Dwarvish, Orc, Sylvan, and of course, Telepathy.

DM: Oh, god. Okay.

Bard2: I don't know if that's a language, but it's in here.

DM: No, no, no, I, yeah. Alright, cool.

Bard2: It's in there.

\[back and forth]

DM: But yeah, that is what you see in your vision.

Bard2: She goes, did you all experience that when you touched that thing?

Wizard: Yeah. I did.

\[back and forth]
